- Python 🐍
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🔍 Techniques Applied

- **Data Preprocessing**
- **Distance Matrix Calculation**
- **KMeans Clustering**
- **Hierarchical Clustering**
- **Dimensionality Reduction (PCA)**
- **2D Cluster Visualization**

## 📁 Files

- `San Francisco Airport - Clustering.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing full analysis, modeling, and visualizations.

## ✅ Workflow

1. **Loading and Exploring Flight Data**
2. **Data Cleaning and Normalization**
3. **Clustering Airport Routes or Stations**
4. **Visualizing Clusters**
5. **Interpreting Operational Insights**
